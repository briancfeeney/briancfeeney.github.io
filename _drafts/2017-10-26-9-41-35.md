I keep a playlist in iTunes called The Current. It's a constantly pruned playlist of songs I'm into at the moment. Old songs, new songs, old favorites, new favorites. Whatever I most want to play when I hit the shuffle button. It's best when it's less than twenty or so tracks. Sometimes it's as small as five tracks or so. As soon as I feel I've heard a track enough lately, I'll remove it. 

I have it [shared online](https://itunes.apple.com/us/playlist/the-current/idpl.u-8Z6ToeX2DZ), too, if you're an Apple Music user.
