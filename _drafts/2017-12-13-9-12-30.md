This year, I listened to a ton of music, much more than I had since 2013. It was my choice of escape, the place where I could focus my attention when the rest of the world was too much. Thankfully, there was a ton of great music released. And I made a strong effort to search out and discover music I might not have enjoyed previously.

I made a public playlist of my [favorite tracks of 2017](https://itunes.apple.com/us/playlist/2017-favorite-tracks/pl.u-g1y4F5R8jk4) on Apple Music.
