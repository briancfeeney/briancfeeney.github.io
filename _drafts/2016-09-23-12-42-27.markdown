September 13, 2015, I pick up my Apple Watch at the SoHo Apple store. September 13, 2016, Watch OS3 is released. I like the coincidence that my experience with the first version of the watch was an exact year. There's nothing important about this, nor any big take away. It just feels right.

Around January, after three months of wearing the watch, I began considering going back to my previous non-smart watch. It had lost its newness, had become just a thing. But I kept wearing it. 

When people asked me what I thought about it, I had a stock answer: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. There was nothing *amazing* about it, but there were enough small benefits which I appreciated. I was tracking more steps. I have a year's worth of heart rate monitoring. I prefer a buzz on this wrist over the pocket vibration of the phone when a text comes in. It's often much nicer to control audio volume and other music/podcast stuff from the watch. The weather temperature on the watch is great. Setting timers on the watch for cooking is also a big plus.

All these things add up to something. I could do without any one of them. But taken all together, it gets harder to convince myself to actually do it.

Now there's the Watch OS3 and the watch is even better. The UX design is what it should have been from the beginning.
