September 13, 2015, I pick up my Apple Watch at the SoHo Apple store. September 13, 2016, Watch OS3 is released. I like the coincidence that my experience with the first version of the watch was an exact year. There's nothing important about this, nor any big take away. It just feels right.

Around January, after three months of wearing the watch, I began considering going back to my previous non-smart watch. It had lost its newness, had become just a thing. But I kept wearing it.
