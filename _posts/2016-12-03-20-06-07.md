Maria Popova highlights some [pertenant thoughts from Carl Sagan](https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/11/09/carl-sagan-demon-haunted-world-ignorance-compassion/) for those of us living at the end of 2016:

> In the way that skepticism is sometimes applied to issues of public concern, there is a tendency to belittle, to condescend, to ignore the fact that, deluded or not, supporters of superstition and pseudoscience are human beings with real feelings, who, like the skeptics, are trying to figure out how the world works and what our role in it might be. Their motives are in many cases consonant with science. If their culture has not given them all the tools they need to pursue this great quest, let us temper our criticism with kindness. None of us comes fully equipped.

Compassion over criticism.
