Paul Robert Lloyd on [coporate design](https://paulrobertlloyd.com/2018/02/corporate_designers):

> Designers like to talk about how they finally have a seat at the table. It’s an attractive idea, especially since companies have started to build internal design teams rather than outsource to agencies. But sometimes it feels as if designers have been tricked into thinking they have a seat, when in fact they’ve been taken hostage, only to develop Stockholm syndrome.

This is such an interesting problem. One that has struck me before, but in a vague way I hadn't been able to articulate nearly as clearly. I'm not yet convinced it's accually happening, but I'm not done thinking about it.
