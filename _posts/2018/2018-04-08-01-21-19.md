Wired.com, [It's Time For an RSS Revival](https://www.wired.com/story/rss-readers-feedly-inoreader-old-reader):

> For many of you, that means finding a replacement for Digg Reader, which went the way of the ghost this month. Or maybe you haven't used RSS since five years ago, when Google Reader, the beloved firehose of news headlines got the axe.

So many posts these days calling for a big return of RSS. I'm here for it.
