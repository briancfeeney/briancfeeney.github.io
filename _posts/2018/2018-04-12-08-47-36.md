I've unsubscribed from nearly every email newsletter I've ever signed up for. It's no surprise to me that [Jason Kottke sees a large number of unsubscribers after every email sent](https://kottke.org/18/04/the-only-winning-move-is-not-to-play). Two obvious reasons and one personal one. Obvious: 1) people forget or don't care they're subscribed until the email arrives, and 2) the easiest way to unsubscribe is *at the bottom of the newsletter email they want to unsubscribe from*. If another email never comes, they'll never remember or care to unsubscribe. The personal: I'm not the kind of person who wants causual reading content in my email inbox. It just doesn't belong. There are plenty of newsletters I'd love to subscribe to, and would probably greatly enjoy reading, if I could send them somewhere which isn't my email address. I'm sure I'm not the only one.
