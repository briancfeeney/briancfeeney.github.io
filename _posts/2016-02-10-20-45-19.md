Opened up Pinterest for the first time in a while, actually interested in looking through it. It seems well over half, the pins were "picked for you" or recommendations. I counted 75 of them in a row. The percentage might have been closer to 95%, the.  Did everyone stop using Pinterest? Is the lack of fresh pins the reason I had so much crap in my feed? Or had I been too lax about reporting my distinteret with particular pins?

Regardless, it's just another example of how uninterested I've become with social media. Turns out it wasn't hard to give up Instagram. Only two posts this year, and I've barely looked at in weeks. Facebook has made me curious again, though. I'm thinking about un-unfollowing everyone I hid to see what my feed would look like full of *all* the garbage. More interesting? Less interesting?

I really only care about RSS. It's the only good stuff.
