I'd love to try switching to Apple Maps, but it seems a little useless without all the data I currently have in Google Maps, all those saved/faved locations. I've done some preliminary Googling, but haven't yet found a way to export from Google into Apple. This is a huge oversite, right? Should be painfully easy.
