Starting designing the UI for Feeeds today and it’s looking really nice. A thousands times better than my attempt last year. Not sure what clicked, but I’m feeling like this idea has steam again. It’s looking like an actual product I can see myself using. I can see other people wanting to use this, too. 

I’m going to take Chris’ advice and present this to an Ember meet up at some point.
