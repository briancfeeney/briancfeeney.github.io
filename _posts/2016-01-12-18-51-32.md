I've stopped visiting Pinterest. It's been weeks or months since I've been in the habit of looking through the site. At least six months since I tried keeping up to date with my stream. I've reached a saturation point with visual inspiration. I'm on the other end of the pendulum swing: I need to be making things.

I've also rarely kept up with Twitter, and mostly that's just my short list of people I most care about. Instagram has lost its grip on me. Facebook I stopped reading well over a year or go, or two. 
	
It's the end of social networks for me. I'm over them. The other things which really matter to me anymore are blogs and long-reads. It's why I'm so obsessed with building an RSS reader. It's another world out there outside the walled garden of social apps. It's a bigger world, and far more interesting.
