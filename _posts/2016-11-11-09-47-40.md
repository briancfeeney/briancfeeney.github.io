For all of my adult life, my personal mantra has been, “Be better.” Every day, I try to improve myself in one of the thousands of ways a person can be a better human. A person can improve their empathy, kindness, generousness, understanding, compassion. A person can improve their talents, whether they be in the sciences, in law, or the arts, to be of more use to our communities. A person can better inform themselves of history, science, philosophy, civics, mathematics. Be better. In some way, every day, be better.

In the course of a month, I try to have expanded the full circle, to have grown outwards in every virtuosic direction possible. There is no way to measure my progress. There are no benchmarks one passes on the way to becoming a good person. There are no apps to record a score. This isn’t a competition. This is a private and personal mission that I be more proud of myself today than I was yesterday. That I be of more use to others tomorrow than I am today.

This week, I’ve realized I’ve seriously neglected my understanding of civic duty. Until yesterday, I couldn’t name all of my state and local representatives. I still don’t know exactly what to say if I were to contact them with requests as a constituent. I will be better at this by this time next year. It’s a new promise to myself, to improve upon a new degree on my circle of personal progress.
