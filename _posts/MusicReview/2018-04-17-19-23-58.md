This Kilo Kish track *Hello, Lakisha* is so good. It's somewhere in the universe of Architecture in Helsinki, Deerhoof, Belle & Sebastian, etc. The instrumentation is full of horns and four-on-the-floor kick drums, and plucky violin keyboard stabs. The change-ups come quick and often, making this 1:38 long track seem so much longer than it is. There's so much to like in here. Her charm is also cranked up to 11. You'd definitely want to follow this person from one party to the next.
