This Kilo Kish track *Hello, Lakisha* is so good. It's somewhere in the universe of Architecture in Helsinki, Deerhoof, Belle & Sebastian, etc, and not at all what I was expecting from someone associated with The Internet and Vince Staples. The instrumentation is full of horns, four-on-the-floor kick drums, and plucky violin keyboard stabs. The change-ups come quick and often, making this 1:38 long track seem so much longer than it is. Her charm is also cranked up to 11, and I'm convinced I'd follow this person from one party to the next.
