I'm a big user and fan of [Cushion](http://cushionapp.com), a web app which makes being a freelancer much much easier. It was created by Jonnie Hallman, a good dude, only a couple years ago and is currently doing really well. Which is great. I do credit Cushion with helping me become a freelancer.

A month ago, they published [a short interview with me](http://cushionapp.com/talking-shop/brian-feeney/) on their site. I'm incredibly honored.
