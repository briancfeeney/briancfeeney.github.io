In July, I wrote that 2016 was the year social media died for me. That continues to be true. I look through Instagram a little bit, catching about half of what’s posted, I'm guessing. I open Facebook a few times a week, mostly to see if I'd missed any notifications or direct messages — I deleted Messenger from my phone. Pinterest is less interesting at the moment; everything is starting to look repetitive. Twitter has become a Trump toilet; I can’t look at it for more than a few minutes a day.

I do keep up with my RSS feeds.
