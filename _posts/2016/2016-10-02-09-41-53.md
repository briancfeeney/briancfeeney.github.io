[Worst of McMansions](http://www.mcmansionhell.com) is one of the best blogs for our times. Not only does it roast the tastelessness of so many babyboomer home owners, but also the Trumpian-esque obsession with appearance of wealth. My generation is going to spend millions of $$$ bulldozing these homes over the next few decades.
