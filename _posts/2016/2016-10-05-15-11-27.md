Jason Kottke from [this post](http://kottke.org/16/10/philip-glass-own-your-work-and-get-paid-for-it) about [this Philip Glass interview](https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/philip-glass-on-controlling-your-output-and-getting-paid-for-what-you-make/): 

> Iâ€™ve been thinking a lot about the economics of writing online. Making a comfortable living only by writing is tough and very few independents are able to do it. More successful are those who are able to get away from writing online by speaking at conferences, writing books, starting podcasts, selling merchandise,1 post sponsored tweets and Instagram photos, building apps, consulting for big companies, etc. This stuff is the equivalent of the band that tours, sells merch, composes music for TV commercials, etc. But as Glass said, what about those who just want to write? (And I count myself among that number.) How can we support those people?

This is something I've been thinking about lately and having actually been working on. Jason says at the end, "Anyway, more on this very soon (I hope)." I'm very curious what this "more" is.
