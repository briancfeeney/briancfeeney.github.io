Jeremy Keith [writes](https://adactio.com/journal/11102) what I've long believed about pull quotes online. They're a vestigial design element which was ported from print to digital without fully understanding their purpose. On the web, they are useless and distracting. I have never and would never use them in a design. But in print, they do have a practical use. They help catch the eye of someone flipping through pages. A good pull quote in a magazine could lead someone to read the entire article, in the same way a good photograph would. On the web, no one is ever going to casually pass the pull quote. If they see it, chances are near 100% they are already reading the full article. Letâ€™s stop using them on the web, please.
