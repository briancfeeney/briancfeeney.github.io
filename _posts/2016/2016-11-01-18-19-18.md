Jason Kottke (of [Kottke.org](http://kottke.org/)), is now [offering anual memberships]([kottke.org memberships](http://kottke.org/16/11/kottkeorg-memberships) ) to his site. As far as I can tell, members get nothing more than non-members other than the satisfaction of supporting a writer they admire. I paid my yearly dues. There is a small select group of blogs which I've been reading for a decade or more, and Kottke.org is one of them. I'm more than happy to fund more of his writing.

And this goes hand in hand with the thing I'm trying to build [Feeeds.me](http://feeeds.me), which I've been calling a *Newsreader for Writers*. I believe there is a market out there for online writers who need better tools for connecting with their audience in every way: reading, sharing, financial support. It's been designed. It's only waiting on someone to build it with me.
