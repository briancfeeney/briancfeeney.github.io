Ruth Whippman writing about [the American obsession with happiness](http://www.vox.com/first-person/2016/10/4/13093380/happiness-america-ruth-whippman):

> To an outsider, it can sometimes feel as though the entire population has a nationwide standardized happiness exam to take and everyone is frantically cramming the night before to get a good grade. Like a stony-faced “that’s hilarious” after a joke in place of laughter — another mildly unnerving staple of conversation in this country — it appears that somewhere along the line, the joy has been sucked out of American happiness.

I nodded along with this entire article.
