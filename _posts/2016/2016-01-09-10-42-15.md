There's a new social network taking off called Peach. It looks basically like Path + Tumblr, and is currently only viewable in app. I joined like just about everyone else, but it still seems boring. There are some cool Slack-like features, but that's not enough to distinguish itself. I'd rather make a Slack channel for my friends. 

There's a real potential to build a new social network that people would love to switch to. Twitter and Facebook are wearing thin. For my crowd — a decidedly Twitter crowd — the world of social networks is too caged in. I'm _still_ thinking my Feeeds idea is a great one. It's a social network which builds off all the others, and it encourages personal blog ownership. People in my crowd have blogs. Most of them are going unused. We all _want_ to use them, but it's difficult to see how. The online world needs a big push, someone to say, "Here is how your blog will become useful again." I believe a lot of of people will respond to that.
