Found a lot of food for thought in [this article](https://aeon.co/essays/what-if-jobs-are-not-the-solution-but-the-problem) exploring what our country would/will look like when a lack of jobs becomes permanent.
 
> Until now, the principle of productivity has functioned as the reality principle that made the American Dream seem plausible. ‘Work hard, play by the rules, get ahead’, or, ‘You get what you pay for, you make your own way, you rightly receive what you’ve honestly earned’ – such homilies and exhortations used to make sense of the world. At any rate they didn’t sound delusional. By now they do.

At this point, it doesn't seem like solving income inequality would do much to curb the upcoming issues with the Amerian job market.
