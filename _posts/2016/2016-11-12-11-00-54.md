Emily Ellsworth gives advice on [how to best contact your representatives in government](https://storify.com/editoremilye/i-worked-for-congress-for-six-years) with a post on Storify.

John Harris posted [a useful summary](http://www.metafilter.com/163382/Strategy-for-calling-your-representatives) on MetaFilter:

> Summary:  
- Tweeting and Facebook are ineffective.  
- Both emails and letters to Washington DC offices are less effective than letters to state offices.  
- Most effective were personal phone calls. These can be really powerful, especially in bulk, as she discovered when a local radio host broadcast their number.  
- Emails were so overwhelming that they used automated software to sort through and categorize them.  
- To talk to a representative in person, the easiest way is to show up at Town Hall meetings, which are usually under attended, and mostly the same people show up every time.  
- Be nice to staffers. If you work for an advocacy group, maybe invite staffers to events. Staffers are both the easiest to contact the ones who run the representative's "ground game."  

I've been looking for exactly this information all week.
