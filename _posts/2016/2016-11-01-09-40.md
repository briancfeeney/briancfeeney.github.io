Andy Baio has [redesigned his blog, Waxy](http://waxy.org/2016/11/redesigning-waxy-2016-edition/). In addition to reprising the current state of the old blogosphere, he has this to say:

> But the ecosystem for independent publications is fundamentally broken. Getting discovered, building a readership, and profiting from your work as an independent writer are all much, much harder than they used to be.

These are exactly a few of the things I've been thinking deeply about for the last couple of years. Working on it.

P.S. Jason Kottke's [post about the new Waxy](http://kottke.org/16/11/a-redesigned-waxyorg-and-the-freedom-of-indie-blogs).
