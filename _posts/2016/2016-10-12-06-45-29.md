From MetaFilter: [What am I making a big ceremony out of and not even aware I'm doing it?](http://ask.metafilter.com/301211/What-am-I-making-a-big-ceremony-out-of-and-not-even-aware-Im-doing-it) One of my favorite responses:

> I grew up in the midwest and have always considered it a normal thing to give first-time visitors a tour of your home. Which, you know, is pretty weird when you think about it.

Being from the midwest, I've been subjected to these home tours dozens of times, and occasionally I will get the sneaking suspicion there was something off about it.
