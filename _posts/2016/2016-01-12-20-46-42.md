[This interview with David Bowie](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bdL3NR9Yno0) from 1999, in which he talks about the future of the internet, is reminding me that I haven't tackled thoughts like that in a long time. I only read think pieces on the Internet now. I'd love to read more about art vs. the Internet vs. culture ... I miss my brain being tickled in that way. I've got to get back to reading those books which really challenged me. Got to find them first.
