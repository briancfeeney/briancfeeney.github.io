David Bowie died yesterday. I woke up this morning at 4am, went for a glass of water, glanced at my phone and saw the news: an NYT notification confirming the death. It took me at least a half hour to fall back asleep. I cried a little. Bowie meant a lot to me in a way that's hard to describe. His effect on me was more channeled through the artists he inspired who more directly touched my life: Blur, Suede, B&S. Of course I discovered Bowie's music early on, and connected with it deeply, but I believe I haven't made it all the way through. There are still records I've only heard, and not truly listened to. Bowie's music will have new things to share with me the rest of my life. 

It's been a weird day. Hard to think of much else. Rest in peace, David Jones.
