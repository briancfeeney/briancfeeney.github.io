App idea: Public House, a community building app which intends to generate more neighborly communities. Any bar can register themselves, and any person can sign up to any bar. But a person can only connect themselves to one bar at a time â€” it's their local. The feed from a bar is viewable only by those who join it, and only those who belong to it can comment. The idea is that via digital means, we help create a physical space where people go to meet and be with their neighbors, to share items, have discussions, make friends. Bars have all the potential to be this now, but there is no cultural impetus to make it happen. 

Neighborhoods need central gathering spaces. Churches and town squares or markets used to be these, but they aren't anymore. 

If you choose, the app can share to other members if you're there or not. It can show how many members are in the bar at a given time. Etc.
