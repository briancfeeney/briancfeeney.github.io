From MetaFilter: [What am I making a big ceremony out of and not even aware I'm doing it?](http://ask.metafilter.com/301211/What-am-I-making-a-big-ceremony-out-of-and-not-even-aware-Im-doing-it) One of my favorite responses:

Being from the midwest, I've been subjected to these home tours dozens of times, and occasionally I will get the sneaking suspicion there was something off about it.
