Debbie Millman tweeted a sneak peek at [the new Kodak packaging](https://twitter.com/debbiemillman/status/788497357767749632) (from the AIGA Design Conference). Really impressive.

Equally impressive is the history of Kodak packaging and branding, which you can peruse via [a Pinterest search](https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=kodak%20packaging&rs=typed&term_meta%5B%5D=packaging%7Ctyped). Just spent a good deal of time scrolling through all this amazing stuff.
