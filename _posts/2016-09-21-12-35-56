Gorillaz have, without warning, restarted posting Twitter and Instagram this week. Pretty good marketing stuff. Seems clear that by the end of the week there will be new album news, if not a surprise album release. Hereâ€™s hoping for the latter. Would really help my mood to have a new Gorillaz record to listen to.
