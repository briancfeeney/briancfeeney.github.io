title: Freelance Life Review #6
---
Freelance Life Review #6 (I think it’s six). Not much changed from last month. January was 100% CardStack income, which worries me a bit. February will likely be 100% CardStack income, as well. I’m still chasing down Frank Golding to close out my $1000 invoice with him for Run or Pass. I need to bug Jeff about the $1k he owes me, too. I have some Denizen work coming up, though it’s small stuff. And there will be some small HSE work. Portigal is still dragging on, but right at the moment, much of that is on me. I _need_ to buckle down this week and finish it. I _need_ to.

I’m considering taking a full desk at Friends. I’ve been working from home probably more than 50% of the time the last few weeks, in part because I feel weird about being there all the time without paying what everyone else is.

I’m on track to make my minimum for 2016. But I could stand to pick my hustle in order to get to my goal. I can do it.
