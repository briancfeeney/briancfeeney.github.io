> Non-rich people tend to spend 100 percent of their income, or close to it. Rich people don't. They spend, say, 50 percent of their income and save the rest. This difference is called the "marginal propensity to consume," and it seems like it might be a problem if income inequality is rising.

This idea is not new, but [a Mother Jones article](http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/09/new-study-says-rising-inequality-killing-economy) has a couple of visuals proving the point. It's so common-sense that I often feel I came upon it on my own, and I am by no means an economist.
