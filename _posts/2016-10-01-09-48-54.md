From [Reading Lists Are The New Mixtapes](https://bookwitty.com/text/reading-lists-are-the-new-mixtapes/578e28acacd0d01113182927):

> [T]ailor-made reading lists can function in the way that mix-tapes once did: to define a memorable time in our life, the way we think about a particular life juncture, the way we feel about the extraordinary times we live in. 

There seems to be an unspoken collective agreement that this shift is taking place. Sharing a reading list is, I guess, a similar act of friendship, but reading lists will never carry the emotional weight of a mix-tape.
