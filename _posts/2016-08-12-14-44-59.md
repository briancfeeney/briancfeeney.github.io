Tom Critchlow has written down [seven ways to get back into blogging](http://tomcritchlow.com/2016/08/09/blogging-not-blogging/).
This is my favorite piece of advice from him:

> Networked writing - aka blogging - is all about content as an idea vector. A conversation starter from me to you - if I write this and email it to you that will spark something. If you email it and send it to 5 people youâ€™re sparking the same idea in 5 different ways. So forget writing for the words, write for the space between the word, between the ideas - write as connective tissue between people.

Blogging is about the conversation. You can write full articles if you choose to, but the atomic level of blog writing is the sketch of a thought.
