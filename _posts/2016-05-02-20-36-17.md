[Ask Brooklyn Museum](https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/ask) was officially released this month, moving out of its year-long beta phase. The reviews have started to roll in and they're positive so far. I'll try to keep a running list here: [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/30/arts/design/at-the-brooklyn-museum-with-a-chatty-curator-in-your-pocket.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FBrooklyn%20Museum&action=click&contentCollection=timestopics&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=1&pgtype=collection&_r=0), [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2016/4/22/11464054/brooklyn-museum-ask-app-bot-human). It was a winner of [two 2016 MUSE Awards](http://aam-us.org/about-us/grants-awards-and-competitions/muse-awards/past-award-winners/2016-muse-awards): a Gold award for mobile applications, and the Jim Blackaby Memorial Award. I've also written a [case study](http://brianfeeney.us/work/askbrooklynmuseum), going into fuller detail about the design of the app.
