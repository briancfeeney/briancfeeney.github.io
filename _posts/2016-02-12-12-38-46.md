Royally fucked up with Portigal.com development this morning. I added all his new posts to staging, which triggers an avalanche of emails and tweets. It effectively soft-launched the site and made public the staging version. I'm incredibly embarrassed. It's been an hour and my chest still feels heavy and hollow. 

I woke up with Portigal on my mind last night and couldn't shake it. And so was aching to get to work this morning and fixing all the last few todos. Then this. 

I'm done with Wordpress development. Maybe backend development entirely. Huge lessened learned here.
