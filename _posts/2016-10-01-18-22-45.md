January 2015: I had an immediate emotional connection to the [Vista Las Palmas](https://www.google.com/search?q=Vista+Las+Palmas&espv=2&biw=1440&bih=776&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwic7LWt07rPAhUBCz4KHW2ZBU4Q_AUIBygC#tbm=isch&q=Vista+Las+Palmas+Palm+Springs) neighborhood of Palm Springs. We stayed in an Alexendar home for a weekend with friends, and I had never felt so centered. Mid-century design has always been of my taste, but it wasn't until that short vacation that I realized mid-century architecture spoke to me just as deeply. 

Since that trip, my [*Architecture & Furniture* Pinterest board](https://www.pinterest.com/brianfeeney/architecture-furniture/) has become one of my most tended.

The NYT published a round table this week asking [*Why Wonâ€™t Midcentury Die?*](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/06/style/why-wont-midcentury-modern-design-die.html). The general consensus is what I expected: the fashion is here to stay. Mid-century design was hyper-focused on creating objects and materials at human sizes and shapes. It *feels* right because it was *designed to feel right*. It is architecture and furniture and products which are elegant in their simplicity, while also radiating fun, colorful personality. So much stuff is trendy for trendiness' sake, but this isn't true of classic mid-century things. There's a purity there which I latch on to. That beautiful, colorful, playful purity which centers me.
