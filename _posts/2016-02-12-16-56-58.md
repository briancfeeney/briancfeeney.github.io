Last September, I sustained a running injury towards the end of half-marathon training. It was a pull in my IT band, an injury which would eventually work itself out on its own after a few weeks of rest. I had gone to the doctor to diagnose it, and the bill has come to $500+. That's a $500+ bill for an injury which healed itself. And I have health insurance. 

Our health insurance situation in America is in a very sad state.
