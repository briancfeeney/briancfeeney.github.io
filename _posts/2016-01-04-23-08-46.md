New plan for getting through my Instapaper queue: read the shortest article every day, and read the longest article every week. There are 104 articles in there now. I'm wondering how long this will take to get through. More than 14 weeks, probably, as I'll also be adding new things to it. 

**Update:** I've also added another weekly to do: once a week, read the oldest article saved. As of January 30th, I'm down to 79 articles. I've also been adding articles more regularly, (I think because Instapaper has become such a daily habit), and still I'm reducing the bloat. The plan seems to be working.
