[Yes, Science is Political](http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/19/14258474/trump-inauguration-science-politics-climate-change-vaccines) 
 
> [S]cience and politics are plainly related: science is the pursuit of knowledge, knowledge is power, and power is politics.  
The scientific method consists of generating a hypothesis, attempting to disprove the hypothesis through testing, and accumulating those tests to come up with shared knowledge. And that method also contains ideology: our observed, shared world is the real world. This ideology even has a name: empiricism. An incoming president who clearly picks and chooses facts to suit his own version of the world changes the relationship between science and culture, in potentially destructive ways.

Another way of stating Stephen Colbert's joke, "Reality has a well-known liberal bias." 

It never ceases to amaze me that so many people ignore reality for political points. It's perfectly childish.
