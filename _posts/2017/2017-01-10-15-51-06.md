The amount of spammy phone calls I get now is unnacceptable. Whatever happened to the Do Not Call lists? I'm positive I've added my number to official lists in the past. Regardless, I've readded my number to the US government's list at [donotcall.gov](https://www.donotcall.gov). Let's see if this changes anything.
