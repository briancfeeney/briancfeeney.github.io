I just backed Manton Reece's new project on Kickstarter, [Micro.blog](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/manton/indie-microblogging-owning-your-short-form-writing). I can't yet tell if his app is a product that will work for me, but I very much support the idea. More people should have their own blogs. More people should have their own websites. More people should write on the web outside of Facebook and Twitter. And RSS really deserves to come back as a major pillar of the web. RSS needs new products to bolster it, new innovation around it to prop it up and turn it into something as vital to the web as email. This is all possible, and it looks as if Manton is doing good work towards making it happen.
