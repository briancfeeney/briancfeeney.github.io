[Why is Mid-Century Modern Furniture So Damn Popular?](http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/why-is-mid-century-modern-furniture-so-damn-popular-238281)

> Kelsey Campbell-Dologhan, writing for Co.Design, suggested that mid-century furniture has become so ubiquitous as to be synonymous with design itself: "All of this suggests that mid-century design is less a 'style' or era of design as it is a byword for 'design' itself, as opposed to spaces and products that were not 'designed' at all."

If you've studied the work of Henry Dreyfuss or Charles and Ray Eames, you shouldn't be surpised at the longevity of midcentury modern design. They, and hundreds of others, went to great lengths to design and construct objects which were as well-suited to human beings as possible. Size, shape, weight, color. These are all qualities which can have objectively correct (-ish) attributes for their purspose â€” at the very least, correct for the *general* person. Midcentury modern design will last as long as human beings remain shaped the way we are. In other words, it's never going away. It may fall out of *style* for some people for some time. But it's here to stay.
