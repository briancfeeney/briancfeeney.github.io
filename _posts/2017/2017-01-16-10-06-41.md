My take on the meme-of-the-day: Top Ten Records of your Teen Years.

* Blur - Blur
* Suede - Suede
* Belle & Sebastian - If You’re Feeling Sinister
* Luna - Penthouse
* David Bowie - Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars
* Pulp - Different Class
* The Flaming Lips - The Soft Bulletin
* Radiohead - The Bends
* Fountains of Wayne - Fountains of Wayne
* The Beatles - The Blue Album

I’m not sure if that last one is supposed to count, but I listened to those two Beatles compilation records, the red and the blue, for a long long time before I got my hands on the original albums.

I believe I discovered 6 out of the 10 of these after my 16th birthday, a few years after I first started buying records. Before these albums, I was listening to Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Matchbox 20, and not at all inspired by the music. My music tastes had been dictated by time, place, and peer pressure. Everything changed when I heard Blur’s album *Blur* in the spring of 1997. I even remember where I was when I first heard it: on a bus, heading to an away track meet, when a friend handed me his cd player and headphones and had me give it a listen. My entire concept of what music could be expanded infinitely outwards, practically instantly. I spent the next ten years of my life either in and out of record stores. Everything changed for me. Everything.
