From [a Vox explainer](http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/11/14233898/cnn-bombshell-report-russia-blackmail-trump-explained-videotape-sex-money) on the seemingly credible allegation that Russia has compromising information on Trump:

> Given that Trump has survived the release of an audio recording of him bragging about sexual assault, it would presumably have to be something huge.

This is the real kicker. Itâ€™s the simplest, and therefor most probable, explanation for why Trump has been so un-American in his pro-Russia positions.
