Ordered the iPhone X this morning, 3am. The preorder process was extremely convenient because of their pre-confirmation with iPhone Upgrade Program. Once the app finally let me in, it probably took less than a minute to order. Where it went wrong was with the feedback loop. There was one confirmation screen that the phone was successfully ordered, but after leaving the page, there was no way to get back to it. The purchase receipt email didn't come until after 5am, so I had to go back to sleep assuming everything really did work.

It's just a phone, and not a big deal. But when it makes a huge difference between getting it right at 3am versus 8am — as in delivery on November 3rd or possible after Christmas — these feedback loops are important.
