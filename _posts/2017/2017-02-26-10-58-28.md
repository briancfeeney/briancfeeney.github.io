[Here's a nice reflection](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/arts/president-obama-pop-culture.html) on Obama's presidency and his relation to art and culture. 

> “Good historians tend to know the right moment to evaluate a president’s place. They wait until the office is behind him, for the right mix of distance and scholarship. In the meantime, Barack Obama’s performance as president — meaning the performance he gave in the role of president of the United States — was flawless. Culturally speaking, he didn’t use his office to lift up, enlighten and entertain so much as share it”.
