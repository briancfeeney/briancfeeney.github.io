I’ve escaped Twitter. I fled. My only permanent connection now to people of the online world is RSS, is blogs. I highly recommend doing the same. Here’s my advice. Create a folder in your RSS reader and call it *People*. In this folder, add all the feeds from blogs by individual people, and only individual people. My folder includes 232 blogs, and I’d guess there are about 30 to 50 posts from it a day. It’s lovely reading through these posts. It’s a self-curated collection of personal voices I respect and admire. 

Twitter moves too fast to read with any patience. Blogs, however, exist in a slower space-time. When I open my RSS reader, I’m reading text publishing hours ago, or yesterday, or maybe last week (if I’ve been on vacation). The difference is remarkable. I can read as if I’ve just picked up a magazine off the table.

The depth of the ideas are also at a pleasant level for casual reading. And it’s largely free of snark and pith. And, again, because it’s self-curated, the topics are largely in tune with my own interests. If not, it’s an acquaintance’s interest and therefore of interest to me. This is how you find new things. 

Blogs are good.
