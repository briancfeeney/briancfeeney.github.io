I've never been a fan of American football. The game never made sense to me, neither aesthetically nor intellectually. I've given it many chances, though. It's hard to be an American and avoid ever seeing a game. Many of my friends are real fans, and I respect that. But [this article in GQ](http://www.gq.com/story/the-concussion-diaries-high-school-football-cte) about a young man who suffered the effects of CTE which he developed while playing high school football — not even in college, or the NFL, but in *high school* — makes me hope that sport quietly fades away. Why should we continue to support a game which can too often result in the death for those who play it.
