There is a new note app, [Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.org/), which looks remarkably similar to the notes app I've designed. The biggest difference is that the note list only shows note titles. It needs to display the full note, like a blog, untruncated. But this app also allows for *extentions*, which means it's theoretically possible to build an add-on which could alter the look of the app to do what I want.

Going to keep an eye on this.
