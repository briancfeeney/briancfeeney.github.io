I'm very much into Dave Winer's ideas for [reading news online](http://scripting.com/2017/01/05/weStillNeedANetflixForNews.html).

> News needs a common platform that integrates all the news sources that show up on Facebook, but not run for the benefit of Facebook's founders, rather run for the benefit of people with ideas that are newsworthy and people who want to read them. 

and

> We need a union of news orgs, implemented as an web site, with a business model that merges all the different for-pay methods. It should be easy to use like Facebook, but without the conflicts of Facebook and open to bloggers and new voices who aren't controlled by corporate media.

Both of these ideas are incorporated within my concept for [Feeeds.me][http://feeeds.me]. What he's describing is a smarter RSS Reader. One that more smartly connects readers with writers and publications.
