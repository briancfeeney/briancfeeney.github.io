George Lakoff has written a long update to his book *Moral Politics* in the form of a blog post: [A Minority President: Why the Polls Failed, And What the Majority Can Do](https://georgelakoff.com/2016/11/22/a-minority-president-why-the-polls-failed-and-what-the-majority-can-do/). If you haven't read *Moral Politics*, or it's been over a decade (as it was for me) since you last picked it up, I'd place this in your Must Read list. 

Yesterday, between 3 and 4 million people gathered for the Women's March protests all over the country and the world. It felt like Lakoff's theory given life. We're reframing the narrative. The march was about inclusion and equality â€” with female empowerment as a base. America is about inclusion and equality. Let's keep this the story of America.
