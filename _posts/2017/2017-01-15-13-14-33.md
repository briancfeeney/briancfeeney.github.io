A couple great passages from a Wall Street Journal article, [The Need to Read](http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-need-to-read-1480083086).

> The technology of a book is genius: The order of the words is fixed, whether on the page or on the screen, but the speed at which you read them is entirely up to you. Sure, this allows you to skip ahead and jump around. But it also allows you to slow down, savor and ponder.

True. 

> So I’m on a search—and have been, I now realize, all my life—to find books to help me make sense of the world, to help me become a better person, to help me get my head around the big questions that I have and answer some of the small ones while I’m at it.

This is me, too.

I'm forcing myself to read physical books again. For most of my life, I would read 30 or more books a year. The last couple of years? Maybe 2. Social media and blogs/news has a stranglehold on my attention. I very much want to change the balance of my reading diet and consume fiction, again, and classic literature. I'm hoping this will be easier now that my addiction to Twitter has been quelled, and social media in general has lost its luster.
