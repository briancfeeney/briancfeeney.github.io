Albarn revealed today that he has around 40 to 45 Gorillaz tracks in various states of completion, tracks which aren't on *Humanz*. And also that he hopes to continue releasing these songs over the next 18 months or so. To this Albarn fan, the idea of a new Gorillaz track nearly every week is amazing. Please let this happen. Gorillaz, more than most any other project out there, is perfectly suitable for this kind of release cycle.
