[The Music Donald Trump Can’t Hear](http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-music-donald-trump-cant-hear), from the New Yorker.

> [T]he inability, so far, of Donald Trump to get any significant musicians from any of those traditions, rock or country or blues or Broadway, to sing at his Inauguration is not a small comic detail but a significant reflection of this moment in history. It reminds us of just how aberrant Trump and Trumpism is. When the Rockettes have to be coerced to appear at your show—or you’re left to boast of the military bands, directly under your orders, who are playing—one is witnessing not just some snobbish hostility on the part of “Hollywood” entertainers but a deeper abyss between the man about to assume power and the shared traditions of the country he represents. There is no music in this man.

There is something fundamentally wrong with your philosophy if it repulses virtually every popular artist it reaches.
