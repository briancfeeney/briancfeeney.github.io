Has design blogging always been this hollow? There are writers out there I greatly admire, but I'm having a difficult time finding new voices. An online mag I've been following (but not much reading) recently published an article titled "I’ve pioneered UX for 20 years. Here’s what I’ve learned, and what comes next". Sorry. No. Not reading that and I'm no longer following that magazine. I have no patience for a complete lack of humility. In fact, I don't believe good design can even happen without great doses of humility.
