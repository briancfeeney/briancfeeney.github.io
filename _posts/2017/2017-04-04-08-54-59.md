[Upcoming.org](https://upcoming.org/) has relaunched. Congrats to [Andy Baio](http://waxy.org/) on bringing it back to life. I was a backer of the Kickstarter though I barely used the original site, if at all. When Upcoming.org was in its first life, I was in Bloomington, IN, and if I'm remembering right, there wasn't much being shared in that small town. Now that I'm in NYC, I'm hoping to find new stuff to attend.
