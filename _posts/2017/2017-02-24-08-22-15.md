White nationalism is a problem everywhere in America, including [Bloomington, Indiana](https://qz.com/915448/the-american-midwests-anti-trump-resistance-exposes-the-myth-of-a-clear-blue-red-divide/), where I went to school. 

> But for a nation lurching rightward, Bloomington, Indiana, is a bellwether. The current narrative of the blue-red divide in the US holds that big cities and college towns are oases of liberalism, hemmed in by conservative towns and rural areas where the economic troubles of the white working class have given rise to racism, xenophobia, and other forms of bigotry. In this formulation, Bloomington is a Democratic idyll, and those posters plastered on campus are unwanted imports from the surrounding sea of red. But the careful, coordinated targeting of faculty of color at Indiana University suggests otherwise. The truth is that white nationalism courses through every city, town, and county in the USâ€”and so, too, does its burgeoning resistance.
