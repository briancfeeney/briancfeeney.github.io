From [the Atlantic](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2016/12/15/why-so-many-teachers-need-a-second-job-to-make-ends-meet/):

> Teachers pay is 17 percent lower than other professionals with similar training.

This is one of the major reasons our schools struggle to satisfy our expectations. Our brightest and most capable college graduates will never turn to careers in education if the pay continues to hang at 83% of what they'd earn elsewhere. I have the utmost respect for those with the passion and drive to become teachers anyway, despite the low pay. Teachers are heros, and they should be financially rewarded for their service.
