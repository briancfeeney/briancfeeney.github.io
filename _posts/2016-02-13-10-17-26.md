I’m on a mission to listen through my entire iTunes music collection. The goal is to mark as Loved every track I truly rate. Back when iTunes was the singular music collection application, I had all of my music rated and wonderful playlists built which were built off smart filters. A playlist of songs with 3 stars and above. A playlist of songs with 4 stars and above. A playlist of songs rated 5 stars. A playlist of songs rated 4 stars and above I haven’t listened to in over a year. If there’s one thing iTunes gets right, it’s smart playlists. They were perfect.

A some point, I lost all of that rating metadata. I’m not sure when, but it’s probably either from porting my playlist from one computer to another, or perhaps when iTunes Match was introduced. I mourned the loss, but moved to Spotify and started over. Then I jumped to Rdio. Now I’m back with iTunes Music and the option for Smart Playlists are back again. I’m stoked.

So I’m going through my entire music collection again. I made a smart playlist which includes a bunch of filters: tracks I haven’t yet “loved”, tracks I haven’t “skipped”, and tracks with less than 2 plays. It’s currently at 15,620 songs long. Yesterday morning, 15,727. I’m making progress. At this rate it’ll take me a whole year. Maybe faster, maybe slower. So much music.
