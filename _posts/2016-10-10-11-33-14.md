The morning after the 2nd presidential debate and I can’t decide whether it was worth watching. I witnessed some history, but at a cost. I’m feeling sad and awful. The reports coming in are repeating all of the horrible things Trump said and claimed. Reading them is to experience them a second time.

Will I watch the third debate next Wednesday? Answering this question is one of the strangest challenges during the election of 2016. How much attention does Trump really deserve? As a bully and a demagogue and a sexual aggressor, the answer is none. But the GOP nominated him as their party’s representative, and so now we are forced to confront him and everything he represents. Every four years, two people are handed our country’s largest megaphones, and this year one of them is an exemplar of America’s worst. 

We can’t look away. We can't ignore it. Our democracy demands we watch. Or at least participate. Perhaps, as citizens, it’s acceptable to take all of this 2nd and 3rd hand, from Twitter, the magazines, the newspapers. Perhaps there is no need to expose ourselves directly to the ugliness. It’s a very difficult personal decision to make.
