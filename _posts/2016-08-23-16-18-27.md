[Another article](https://thehairpin.com/blog-you-idiots-86995e96d5d5#.e90m3dp01) begging for people to blog again. 

> We need good things to read. We need them steadily, from people whose voices we enjoy. Short things. Commentary about a topic the writer has a greater interest in than you do. Something funny. Something very stupid. Not some big, long, boring thing, just a little thing that you read and enjoy.

I support this whole-heartedly. We should all blog more. And not on Facebook, either. Letâ€™s all blog out in the real world.
