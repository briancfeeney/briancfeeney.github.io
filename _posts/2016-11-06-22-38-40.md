My new (same as the old) [photoblog](http://photos.brianfeeney.us) is up. If I could have, I would have just used the incredibly simple and convenient GitHub Pages. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem possible to have two hosted blogs under one account. So I decided to open an AWS account and try my hand at installing the blog in an S3 bucket. 

For a newbie, it wasn’t as straightforward as hosting on your average server. After a long week of much trial and error, I finally cracked it. The final piece of the puzzle was discovering a fact none of my extensive (and very professionally trained) Googling had revealed: the S3 bucket name needed to be identical to the subdomain in use, which in my case was photos.brianfeeney.us. 

Next on my list of things to learn is auto-deployment. I love that posting to my GitHub Pages blog is as easy as making a commit. Doing so with AWS is going to take some setting up, and I have only the vaguest idea of how to do so. Give me a week.

As for the photos themselves, I'll be posting a few a week, probably. And slowly filling out the past archive.
